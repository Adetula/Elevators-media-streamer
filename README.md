ðŸŽ¯ About

Week 10 in CodeBoxx is the Test Driven Development week where unit tests of code are executed:

The content management module was entirely developed with the "red-green-refactor" method and all traces of the application of this method as requested in the deliverables is found in the `log/rspec.out` file in the project repo.


To get the results in the terminal, the code `bundle exec rspec --format documentation` is run.
